      "question":"When will my parcel be delivered?",
      "answer":"For deliveries to the majority of the UK we deliver on the next working day after the item was sent (this may vary in some locations). When an item is booked with APC Overnight, the sender will specify delivery from our range of services. This is normally for delivery by 9am, 10am, 12 noon or 4pm on the next working day (Monday to Friday). Delivery will be attempted between 8am and the selected delivery time.A Saturday morning service is available to most areas, which is again arranged by the sender of the goods.Rebooked deliveries will be attempted on the same service as originally chosen by the sender and for this reason, we do not offer the option to choose a timed or Saturday service when rebooking a delivery.  Upgrades (to a timed or Saturday service) would need to be arranged by the sender of the parcel.",

      "answer":"Having an account with us makes repeat bookings a lot easier as all of your info is already saved within our system. We appoint an Account Manager to be in regular contact with you to ensure we are meeting expectations and to be proactive in dealing with any issues. It also makes payment a lot easier as we can send you monthly itemised invoices for all activity on your account, rather than having to make payments each time you book. Create an account today! Applications will be reviewed due to freight restrictions.",
